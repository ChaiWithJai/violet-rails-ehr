## 🚀 Quick Start (Choose Your Path)

### Path 1: Just Want to See It Work? (30 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
bundle install

# 2. Setup database
rails db:create db:migrate

# 3. Create FHIR resources
rails runner "load 'db/seeds/fhir_setup.rb'"

# 4. Start server
rails server

# 5. Test FHIR API
curl http://localhost:3000/fhir/metadata | jq
curl http://localhost:3000/fhir/Patient | jq
```

**Read**: `QUICKSTART.md` for detailed commands

### Path 2: Want to Understand the Architecture? (1 hour)

1. Read `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - Understand why we chose this approach
2. Read `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Learn how it works
3. Explore the code in `app/controllers/fhir/` and `app/services/fhir/`

### Path 3: Ready to Build? (2-3 weeks)

1. Follow `NEXT_STEPS.md` week-by-week plan
2. Complete remaining FHIR controllers
3. Add tests, security, deployment

## 📖 Documentation Map

| Document | Purpose | When to Read |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| **START_HERE.md** (this file) | Orientation | First thing |
| **README_EHR.md** | Project overview | Quick reference |
| **QUICKSTART.md** | Get running fast | Want to test it |
| **PROJECT_SUMMARY.md** | Architecture decisions | Understand "why" |
| **IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** | Technical details | Building features |
| **NEXT_STEPS.md** | Implementation roadmap | Planning work |

## 🎓 Key Concepts

### 1. Violet Rails API Namespaces = FHIR Resources

Each FHIR resource (Patient, Observation, etc.) is defined as a Violet Rails API Namespace:

```ruby
ApiNamespace.create(
  name: 'FhirPatient',
  slug: 'fhir-patient',
  properties: { /* FHIR Patient fields */ }
)
```

**Why this works**: Violet Rails stores data as JSONB, perfect for FHIR's flexible schema.

### 2. External API Client = Integrations

Whoop, Apple Health, Fitbit, etc. are integrated via Violet Rails' External API Client pattern:

```ruby
class WhoopSync
  def start
    # Fetch Whoop data
    # Map to FHIR Observations
    # Store in API Namespace
  end
end
```

### 3. FHIR Validation via fhir_models Gem

```ruby
Fhir::Validator.validate_patient(data)
# => { valid: true } or { valid: false, errors: [...] }
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Decision

**We chose Pure Violet Rails** (not GNU Health integration) because:

✅ Rails-first (100% Ruby)
✅ 2-4 weeks timeline (vs 3-4 months for hybrid)
✅ Minimal dependencies
✅ Leverages Violet Rails strengths
✅ No Python/Tryton complexity

**Full analysis**: See `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` section "Architecture Decision"

## 🎯 Current Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| FHIR Namespaces | ✅ Complete | 8 resources defined |
| Validation Layer | ✅ Complete | Using fhir_models |
| Serialization | ✅ Complete | FHIR JSON + Bundles |
| Patient Controller | ✅ Complete | Reference implementation |
| Other Controllers | ⏳ TODO | Copy Patient pattern |
| Whoop Integration | ✅ Complete | Framework ready |
| Tests | ⏳ TODO | Week 2 task |
| Encryption | ⏳ TODO | Week 3 task |
| Deployment | ⏳ TODO | Week 4 task |

## 🔥 Hot Paths

### I want to...

**...see it working right now**
→ `QUICKSTART.md` → Run setup commands → Test with curl

**...understand the architecture**
→ `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` → Read "Architecture Decision" section

**...add a new FHIR resource**
→ `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` → "Adding New FHIR Resources" section

**...integrate another wearable**
→ `app/services/integrations/whoop_sync.rb` → Copy pattern

**...deploy to production**

**...understand why not GNU Health**
→ `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` → "Why Not GNU Health Integration?" section

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### What This IS
✅ Production-ready boilerplate
✅ FHIR R4 API foundation
✅ Extensible architecture
✅ Reference implementation

### What This IS NOT
❌ Complete EMR/EHR system
❌ Turnkey HIPAA certification
❌ Full clinical workflows
❌ Ready-to-use UI (admin dashboard only)

**You need to**: Add your business logic, workflows, and compliance procedures.

## 🚨 Before Production

- [ ] Complete all FHIR controllers
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests
- [ ] Configure encryption (Lockbox)
- [ ] Implement consent management
- [ ] Add authentication to FHIR endpoints
- [ ] Set up monitoring
- [ ] Perform security audit
- [ ] Get legal/compliance review

**Checklist**: See `NEXT_STEPS.md` → "Success Checklist"

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start with one resource**: Get Patient working perfectly before adding others
2. **Test early**: Write tests as you build (Week 2 in NEXT_STEPS.md)
3. **Use the pattern**: Copy `patients_controller.rb` for other resources
4. **Monitor from day 1**: Set up logging and metrics early
5. **Security first**: Don't skip encryption and audit logging

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Setup Issues
→ Check `QUICKSTART.md` → "Troubleshooting" section

### Understanding Code
→ Read `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` → Detailed explanations

### Architecture Questions
